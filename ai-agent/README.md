## OpenAPI KEYS

You need to get your own API keys for OpenAI and Anthropic. You can get them from the [OpenAI dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and [Anthropic dashboard](https://console.anthropic.com/account/keys).

Once you have your API keys, create a file called `.env` in the root directory of the project and add the following lines to it:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY='openai-api-key'
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='anthropic-api-key'
```
